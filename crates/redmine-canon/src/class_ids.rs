//! **Canonical class-id constants** — re-exported from
//! [`ogar_vocab::class_ids`], the single source of truth.
//!
//! ```
//! use redmine_canon::class_ids;
//!
//! fn dispatch(incoming_id: u16) {
//!     match incoming_id {
//!         class_ids::PROJECT_WORK_ITEM   => handle_issue(),
//!         class_ids::BILLABLE_WORK_ENTRY => handle_time_entry(),
//!         _ => {}
//!     }
//! }
//! # fn handle_issue() {}
//! # fn handle_time_entry() {}
//! ```
//!
//! **These are the same constants `op-canon::class_ids` exposes.** Both
//! `-rs` ports re-export from `ogar_vocab` so the values cannot drift
//! across ports: the codebook is minted once in
//! [`AdaWorldAPI/OGAR`](https://github.com/AdaWorldAPI/OGAR) and the typed
//! constants come from there.
//!
//! OGAR carries the forward+reverse drift guards (constants ↔ codebook).
//! This module carries one port-local guard: every concept the **vendored
//! snapshot** promotes must agree with the re-exported constant at the
//! same id — so a regen that drifts from the published codebook fails CI.
