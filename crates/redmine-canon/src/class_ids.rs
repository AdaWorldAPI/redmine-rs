//! Compile-time **canonical class-id constants** — the Redmine view of the
//! OGAR codebook, exposed as named `u16`s so downstream `rm-*` crates can
//! dispatch on identity without parsing the snapshot JSON at runtime.
//!
//! ```
//! use redmine_canon::class_ids;
//!
//! fn dispatch(incoming_id: u16) {
//!     match incoming_id {
//!         class_ids::PROJECT_WORK_ITEM => handle_issue(),
//!         class_ids::BILLABLE_WORK_ENTRY => handle_time_entry(),
//!         _ => {}
//!     }
//! }
//! # fn handle_issue() {}
//! # fn handle_time_entry() {}
//! ```
//!
//! **These are the same values `op-canon::class_ids` exposes** — the
//! codebook is minted once in [`AdaWorldAPI/OGAR`](https://github.com/AdaWorldAPI/OGAR)
//! and shared across both `-rs` ports. A node typed `PROJECT_WORK_ITEM`
//! (`0x0102`) is the same identity whether it came from Redmine's `Issue`
//! or OpenProject's `WorkPackage`. That is the whole point: the consumer
//! holding both curators dispatches on one arm.
//!
//! Constants are **kept in sync with the vendored snapshot mechanically**:
//! [`tests::constants_match_the_snapshot`] asserts the vendored
//! [`crate::Snapshot`] reports the same `(canonical_concept, id)` pair for
//! every constant. Drift is impossible without a failing test.
//!
//! Ids are stable forever (per the OGAR codebook contract). They only
//! arrive — never move, never get re-assigned.
